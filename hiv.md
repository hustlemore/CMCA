Cannabis and HIV
Cannabis helps alleviate the symptoms of HIV and associated medications.

These symptoms include: 
* Nausea and vomiting
* Weakness
* Loss of appetite
* Loss of weight
* Pain
* Aches in bones
* Swelling
* Lack of sleep
* High anxiety

Often, cannabis can be more effective than other pharmaceutical drugs in alleviating the symptoms of HIV treatments. Illinois doctors now recognize cannabis as an effective tool as part of an HIV therapy regimen.
